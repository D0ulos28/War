# War Card Game

Welcome to War, a Python implementation of the classic card game.

## Game Description

This is a simple card game created in Python, based on a variation of the traditional "War" game as I grew up playing it. You can play against up to 3 other players or challenge the AI.

### How to Play

1. Each player draws a card.
2. The player with the highest card value wins the round.
3. In case of a tie, a "War" is initiated:
   - Each player draws 4 cards.
   - The total value of these 4 cards determines the winner.
4. The winner collects all cards played in the round and adds them to their deck.
5. The game continues until one player has all the cards.
